# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The main goal of this project is to :
- Introduce us to the actual, real world data.
- How we can interact with APIs.
- Compare the APIs
- Explore,clean,analyse the data from APIs
- Different aspects of data modelling(like Regressions & classification)


## Process
- **Importing Data:** I start requesting the APIs to get the response. I try to request the relevent fields only
- **Exploring:** I start with deep diving into data to get the better understanding of the dataset. 
- **Preparing:** Then I start prparing my data that include cleaning as well so that my data could be able to answer the questions asked.
- **Descriptive Analytics:** At this step I try to find what is exactly going on with this data.
- **Predictive Analytics:**  I try to find what could happen with data.I start building model for this.


## Results

- Both the APIs have their oun points of interest.
- **Quality over Quantity:** Like Fousquare API provides more data with vast collection of fields but this data is inconsitent and incomplete.On the other hand Yelp API gives less but intensive data.
- Model buildig here is quite tricky.I feel that it provides the insufficient sample size which could not satisfy the basic assumptions of the model.

## Challenges 
- Insufficient data( No of bikes available is very less. May be it happens only in my chosen city)
- API Query limit.
- Both the APIs provide duplicate results for a single locations.
- Poor connection between data from City Bikes API and other two APIs.
- choosing the city to take ahead is bit tricky as the quality and quantity of data depends on the chosen city.I try to crack it as I first choose 'New York' city but I found that no of networks coreesponding to this city is only one than I choose other city named 'Calais' which has two networks. But still I found that available data corresponding to this city is also not sufficient to consider as Sample.
- I have to compromise my sleep to complete this project. So body and time constraints was also a challenge for me.

## Future Goals
- I will try to spend more time in exploring the data. Want to try with more cities.
- Want to explore more fields and connecting fields.
- Want to include more numerical fields in my regression.
- Want to provide more description and interpretation about the results of classification model. For example using Confusion Matrix
